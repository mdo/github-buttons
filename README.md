# GitHub Buttons

Showcase your GitHub (repo's) success with these static buttons featuring links to your GitHub repo or profile page and up-to-date watch, fork, and follower counts.

To get started, checkout <https://ghbtns.com/>!

## Bug tracker

Have a bug? Please create an issue here on GitHub at <https://github.com/mdo/github-buttons/issues>.

## Development

The GitHub buttons source code is split across three files in `src/`â€”the HTML, CSS, and JS. We then use inline-source-cli and html-minifer to create the dist `github-btn.html` file which includes everything.

To build the files, just run `npm run build`.

Lastly, the `https://ghbtns.com/` site is built with Jekyll (requires Ruby and more). Install [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and run a local server to view your changes:

```shell
$ jekyll serve
```
