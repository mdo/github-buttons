## Development

Clone the project and install dependencies before getting started. GitHub Buttons require Node.js, Ruby, and Bundler for local development.

```shell
npm i
bundle i
```

The GitHub buttons source code is split across three files in `src/`â€”the HTML, CSS, and JS. We use inline-source-cli and html-minifer to include it all in the compiled [`docs/github-btn.html`](docs/github-btn.html) file. To build this file:

```shell
npm run build
```

The `https://ghbtns.com/` site is built with Jekyll. After installing the dependencies, you can run a local server:

```shell
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

Open `http://127.0.0.1:4000` to browse locally.
