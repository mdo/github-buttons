## Development

The GitHub buttons source code is split across three files in `src/`—the HTML, CSS, and JS—and compiled with [gulp](http://gulpjs.com).
The `github-btn.hml` file contains the button markup and includes the external CSS and JS. Those includes are inlined and the overall page minified with gulp.

To build the files, just run gulp:

```shell
$ gulp
```

Lastly, the `https://ghbtns.com` site is built with Jekyll (requires Ruby and more). Install [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and run a local server to view your changes:

```shell
$ jekyll serve --watch
```
